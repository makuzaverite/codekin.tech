#### What is a MonoRepo

The term "monorepo" refers to a version controlled repository that contains many other projects. [Google](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext), has anounced to be storing all of their code-base into a single reposity which is approximately 80Ts of storage, Microsoft, facebook and twitter announced to be using monorepo for their internal code but they are also other which announced have never used monorepos including apple, ubur and many others.


#### The following are some of the reasons why you would like to use monorepo.

1. Everyone will see everyone else's code, resulting in higher quality code for your orgnization.
2. Since they have the same source of truth, continuous integration and delivery can be easily automated easily.
3. Monorepo allows you to reuse the same logic through several projects within the same code base.
4. Since everybody is inverted in keeping up with chacked, using monorepo will help you and your organization have timeline realase.
5. etc...

With that said, monorepos have a few disadvantages that I'll go over here to help you decide when to use them and when not to.


#### Reasons why monorepo might not be appropriate.


1. Persomance on  large monorepo is really touch problem
2. The scalability of VCS can be very difficult; imagine running git status in an 80Tbs repository and seeing how long it would take.
3. If the designs are interdependent, the learning curve will be difficult for new developers.
4. etc..

There is a good read about monorepo [here](https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo) if you want to continue reading about it.


### Let's setup a TypeScript monorepo

In order to achieve this we are going to use the following tools

- [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)

   We use yarn workspaces to reduce the reputations becouse in monorepo we are dealing with many packages so it can be difficult to manage them indipandently.

- [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

  Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.


- [scripty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scripty)

  This simplifies script management within our rapidly expanding monorepo.

In this post we are going to create a monorepo which will have three packages two of which depends on each and others which doesn't.


 #### setup

Initialize `package.json` with

 ```bash
 npm init -y
 ```

 add the follwoing code to `package.json` to initlize the workspace

```bash

 mkdir packages
 mkdir scripts

 # To handle all scripts

 mkdir scripts/workspace
 mkdir scripts/packages



# our packages

 mkdir packages/calculations
 mkdir packages/utils
 mkdir packages/server
```

```bash
 yarn add --dev scripty
```


```js
{
   "private": true,
   "workspaces": [
        "packages/**"
   ],
   "scripty": {
    "path": "./scripts/workspace"
  }
}
```

Inside the root of your project run


```bash
npx lerna init
```

Our folder structure should look like this as of now

```bash

ts-monorepo
|___ packages
        |___ calculations
        |___ server
        |___ utils
|___ scripts
        |___ packages
        |___ workspace
|--- lern.json
|___ package.json
```



Let's add eslint for linting

```bash
 npx eslint --init
```


Make sure to that you select options like this

![eslint_optimizes](/images/posts/eslint-ts-options.PNG)


Run lets add scripts to manage our packages

Inside your `package.json` under scripts add the following

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "scrippy",
    "dev": "scrippy",
    "lint": "scrippy",
    "start": "scrippy"
  }
```

Add the follwoing scripts directory


```bash
// scripts/workspace/build.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo " üì¶ Building Workspace "
yarn tsc -b packages

```

```bash

//scripts/workspace/start.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo " üßπ Starting server "

```


```bash
//scripts/workspace/lint.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo " üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è LINT: eslint src --ext ts,js,tsx,jsx "
yarn lerna run lint --stream --concurrency 4
```


Add the follwoing scripts packages directory


```bash
//scripts/packages/build.sh


#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Building $(pwd) "
yarn tsc -b

```


```bash
//scripts/packages/lint.sh


#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo " üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è LINT: eslint src --ext ts,js,tsx,jsx "
yarn eslint src --ext ts,js,tsx,jsx

```

Now that you have all scripts setup let's also setup our packages


let's start from the `server` inside `packages/server` run

Inside `utils`


Inside `calculations` add the following



```bash
 npm init -y
```

Inside `package.json` add the follwoing

```bash
  "main": "dist/index.js",
   "scripts": {
    "build": "scripty",
    "lint": "scripty"
  },
  "scripty": {
    "path": "../../scripts/packages"
  },
```


```typeScript
//packages/calculations/add.ts

function sum(num1:number,num2:number):number{
    return num1+num2
}
```


```typeScript
//packages/calculations/product.ts

function multiply(num1:number,num2:number):number{
    return num1*num2
}
```




To lern futher I would like to point out really good open source projects that you can take a look at and learn from how they manage their workflows

1. [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
2. [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
3. [vitejs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
