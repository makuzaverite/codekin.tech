## Making sense graphql

In this post I'll be talking all about graphql and share with you everything you need to know and start writting applications with graphql, I'm really excited and can't wait to share with you!



From the [official website](https://graphql.org/) Graphql a query language for an api. graphql a specification that have been developed to model how people develop and consume apis. People also happen to call graphql  a complete alternative to rest apis.

### What makes graphql special?

- Grapahql lets you reduce the bandwidth by allowing you to call a single api  and return more data fields that would able to do with multiple rest apis.

- It enables clients(consumers) of your api to get what they want which  isn't an option when it comes to the usual way of fetching data with rest.
 
Grapahql have been implemented in almost every popular programming languages and used with help from  awesome open source libraries that you can find mostly on github. incudes the following.


On server side good options include [Apollo server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) for Nodejs, [Gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) for Golang and [graphql-client](https://github.com/graphql-rust/graphql-client) for Rust.


For the client side the popular options include [Apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) , [urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql) and many others.

For the sake of this tutorial we are going to to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to explore graphql and the skills you are going to get from this tutorial, really applies to every graphql implementation.
